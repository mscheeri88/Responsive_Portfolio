# Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive-Portfolio

In this assignment I was to create a responsive portfolio using media queries.  I did this by adding the media query at the end of the CSS file attached to my HTML files.  This would ensure that it was the last piece executed after all other attributes had been set.  The media query was easy to setup for the width, I used a color background to make sure it was adjusting correctly.  I was able then to change the attributes of the pictures, div's, tags, media, etc. to fit the screen with the new width.  I full understand and know how to implement media queries.
